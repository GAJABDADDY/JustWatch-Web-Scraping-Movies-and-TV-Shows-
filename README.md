# JustWatch-Web-Scraping-Movies-and-TV-Shows-

This project involves web scraping data from the JustWatch website using Python and BeautifulSoup. JustWatch is a platform that provides information about movies and TV shows, including streaming availability, ratings, genres, and more.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to extract and analyze data related to movies and TV shows available on JustWatch. The data includes details such as titles, genres, release dates, streaming platforms, ratings, and more.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib and WordCloud (for data visualization)

## Data Extraction and Analysis

1. **Data Collection:** Scraping data from JustWatch using BeautifulSoup to extract movie and TV show details.
3. **Data Analysis:** Performing data filtering and analysis to gain insights into the distribution of genres, ratings, streaming platforms, etc.
4. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing the analyzed data using Matplotlib for bar charts and WordCloud for genre word clouds.

## Key Features

- Scraping movie and TV show details such as titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and streaming platforms.
- Analyzing the distribution of genres, ratings, and other attributes across the scraped data.
- Visualizing the data using bar charts and word clouds to represent genres graphically.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to view the code and run the web scraping and analysis processes.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing machine learning models for predicting movie ratings or recommending content based on user preferences.
- Enhancing the data visualization with interactive plots and dashboards using libraries like Plotly and Dash.
